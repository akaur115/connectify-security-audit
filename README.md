Capstone Project – Connectify: Social Media REST API

# Connectify – A Social Media Platform API
Project Overview

Connectify is a backend API for a simple social media platform. It allows users to create posts, comment, and follow each other. The project shows my understanding of REST API development, authentication, validation, and documentation.

# Why I Chose Social Media

I chose social media because it’s something most people use every day, and I wanted to learn how apps like Instagram or Twitter actually work behind the scenes. It’s a fun and realistic way to practice backend skills.
